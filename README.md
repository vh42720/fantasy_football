#  Fantasy Football Player Performance Prediction

### 1. Introduction

[Fantasy football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy_football_(gridiron)), is a game
in which participants compete as general managers of virtual professional American football
teams. The competitors select their rosters by participating in a draft in which all relevant
NFL players are available. Points are based on the actual performances of the players
in the real-world competition. The game typically involves the National Football League,
but can also involve other leagues, such as the Canadian Football League or NCAA.

### 2. Goals

The main objective of this paper is to predict player performance on the weekly basis (based on
the game schedule). The performance is quantified into 1 numeric metric that can be used
to rank player. Ideally, each position should have their own ranking as each of them
serves a very different purpose on the field. There are 2 benefits of this work:
1. Before the season begins: Managers can start outlining their team for the drafting
process based on player ranking. The ranking at this point is heavily reliant upon
historical performance and recent training results.
2. After the season begins: Managers can trade player for up to 10 weeks after the season
started. After each game, the ranking should help identify valuable players and assist
managers in making appropriate adjustment to their lineups.

The analysis only provide the ranking of player based on their ability to score points
based on the fantasy football scoring rules. The nature of the drafting process ensures
that many strategies are viable using the same player ranking chart.

### 4. Fantasy Football in short

There are many platforms for fantasy football, but the most popular are from:
1. [National Football League - NFL](https://fantasy.nfl.com/)
2. [ESPN](https://www.espn.com/fantasy/football/)
3. [Yahoo](https://football.fantasysports.yahoo.com/)
4. []()

Functionally, each platform is the same. The main difference is their visuals and features.

##### 4.1. Structures

A group of 10 - 12 players/virtual managers together forms a league. Before the season started,
the drafting and scoring rules are determined. The player with the most victory wins the league.

Each fantasy football team consists of these positions:
- 1 Quarterback (QB)
- 2 Running back (RB)
- 2 Wide Receiver (RC)
- 1 Tight End (TE)
- 1 Flex (FL)
- 1 Kicker (K)
- 1 Defense (D)
- 5 bench positions

Each week, the manager must choose their player roster. They cannot change switch out any player
on that roster for that week. If a player is on the bench from their roster, even if they score
in real life, the point is not counted toward the manager's team. Thus, one must choose carefully
as not to bench a wrong player.

##### 4.2. Score & Rules

The score is counted based on the player actual performances on the field. However,
there are 3 ways that each league can decide to translate a player real performance
virtual points. The scoring system is detailed [here from ESPN's article](https://support.espn.com/hc/en-us/articles/360003914032-Scoring-Formats)
1. Standard - which mirrors real life scoring system
2. Half/full - which includes the successful run distance, throw and receives into the score

##### 4.2. Drafting Process
Drafting process and scoring rules are agreed upon the participants before the season starts
across all platforms.
