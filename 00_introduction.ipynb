    "#  Fantasy Football Player Performance Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "[Fantasy football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy_football_(gridiron)), is a game\n",
    "in which participants compete as general managers of virtual professional American football\n",
    "teams. The competitors select their rosters by participating in a draft in which all relevant\n",
    "NFL players are available. Points are based on the actual performances of the players\n",
    "in the real-world competition. The game typically involves the National Football League,\n",
    "but can also involve other leagues, such as the Canadian Football League or NCAA.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "The main objective of this paper is to predict player performance on the weekly basis (based on\n",
    "the game schedule). The performance is quantified into 1 numeric metric that can be used\n",
    "to rank player. Ideally, each position should have their own ranking as each of them\n",
    "serves a very different purpose on the field. There are 2 benefits of this work:\n",
    "1. Before the season begins: Managers can start outlining their team for the drafting\n",
    "process based on player ranking. The ranking at this point is heavily reliant upon\n",
    "historical performance and recent training results.\n",
    "2. After the season begins: Managers can trade player for up to 10 weeks after the season\n",
    "started. After each game, the ranking should help identify valuable players and assist\n",
    "managers in making appropriate adjustment to their lineups.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis only provide the ranking of player based on their ability to score points\n",
    "based on the fantasy football scoring rules. The nature of the drafting process ensures\n",
    "that many strategies are viable using the same player ranking chart.\n",

    "\n",
    "A group of 10 - 12 players/virtual managers together forms a league. Before the season started,\n",
    "the drafting and scoring rules are determined. The player with the most victory wins the league.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each fantasy football team consists of these positions:\n",
    "- 1 Quarterback (QB)\n",
    "- 2 Running back (RB)\n",
    "- 2 Wide Receiver (RC)\n",
    "- 1 Tight End (TE)\n",
    "- 1 Flex (FL)\n",
    "- 1 Kicker (K)\n",

    "- 5 bench positions\n",
    "\n",
    "Each week, the manager must choose their player roster. They cannot change switch out any player\n",
    "on that roster for that week. If a player is on the bench from their roster, even if they score\n",
    "in real life, the point is not counted toward the manager's team. Thus, one must choose carefully\n",
    "as not to bench a wrong player.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 4.2. Score & Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "The score is counted based on the player actual performances on the field. However,\n",
    "there are 3 ways that each league can decide to translate a player real performance\n",
    "virtual points. The scoring system is detailed [here from ESPN's article](https://support.espn.com/hc/en-us/articles/360003914032-Scoring-Formats)\n",
    "1. Standard - which mirrors real life scoring system\n",
    "2. Half/full - which includes the successful run distance, throw and receives into the score\n",
